We will not have access to proctected type variables from another package. To access variables from another package they should
have access modifiers public

So the variats are to modify access of the attribute in public, to create classes in the pachage models or to create subclasses in class Employeer

If the attributes are of the protected type, we can only access them from the same package, the same class, or a subclass

The attributes that are private can be access from the same class
